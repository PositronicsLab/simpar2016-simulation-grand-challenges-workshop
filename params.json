  "tagline": "December 13, San Francisco",
  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nAfter decades of robotic simulations focusing on modeling the dynamics of manipulators, the past decade has seen the introduction and widespread adoption of quality software libraries for simulating the dynamics and sensors of dextrous robots interacting with semi- realistic virtual environments. These libraries, and the algorithms that make them possible, are poised to be the scaffolding that supports virtual prototyping, robust planning, model predictive control, machine learning, and robot testing for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nSignificant challenges clearly remain until approaches become sufficiently robust, fast, and accurate for the two key tasks of robotic manipulation (including grasping) and locomotion. But what about after those problems are “solved”? We hope to identify the robotic tasks for which successful simulation would have the greatest impact on robotics research and industry. This workshop aims to discover the grand challenges the simulation research community should tackle.\r\n\r\n## Targeted participants\r\n\r\nWe aim to stimulate discussion between the following participants:\r\n\r\n* **Simulation researchers.** We are targeting the ability to model robots performing tasks for up to minutes at a time, which typically limits runtimes to no slower than 1/10 realtime. For dynamics, that context has mostly been limited to multi-rigid bodies, but we also invite researchers in flexible body dynamics, fracture, fluid dynamics, for example, to attend.\r\n* **Roboticists who use simulation for virtual testing.**\r\n* **Roboticists who use simulation to generate data for machine learning methods.**\r\n* **Roboticists who use simulation for virtual prototyping.**\r\n\r\n_Those roboticists who require simulations that have proven infeasible or inefficient to model with existing software are particularly encouraged to attend._\r\n\r\n## Workshop format\r\n\r\nThe workshop will comprise two parts:\r\n\r\n1. **Short talks**, in which every participant is given five minutes to talk about their work and five minutes to propose a grand challenge.\r\n2. **Breakout sessions**, in which sub-groups of participants discuss a predetermined topic before presentation to the larger group.\r\n\r\n## Current participant list\r\n\r\n* Matei Ciocarlie (Columbia University)\r\n* John Hsu (Open Source Robotics Foundation)\r\n* Andy Ruina (Cornell)\r\n* Dylan Shell (Texas A&M)\r\n* Michael Sherman (Toyota Research Institute)\r\n* Jeff Trinkle (RPI)\r\n\r\n",
